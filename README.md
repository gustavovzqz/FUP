![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue)

## Overview

This project is a virtual wardrobe implemented in Python. It provides users with the ability to add, view, and remove various types of clothing items. This was my first programming project, and it served as a great learning experience.

## Features

- **Add Clothing Items**: Users can add different types of clothing items to their virtual wardrobe. Each item can have attributes such as name, color, size, and style.

- **View Wardrobe**: Users can view their entire wardrobe to see what clothing items they have stored.

- **Remove Items**: If a user decides to part with a clothing item, they can easily remove it from their virtual wardrobe.
